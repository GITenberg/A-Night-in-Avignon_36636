<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A room in the chambers of</i> <span class="smcap">Petrarca</span> <i>at Avignon. It opens on a
loggia overlooking, on higher ground, the spired church of Santa Clara
and the gray cloisters of a Carthusian monastery. Beyond lie the city
walls under glamour of the blue Provençal night.</i></p>

<p><i>The room, faintly frescoed, is lighted with many candles; some
glittering on a wine-table heavy with wines toward the right front. A
door on the left leads to other rooms, and an arrased one opposite,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<i>down to the street. Bookshelves and a writing-desk strewn with a lute
and writings are also on the left; a crimson couch is in the centre; and
garlands of myrtle and laurel deck the wine-table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gherardo</span>, <i>the monk, is seated by the desk, following with severe looks
the steps of</i> <span class="smcap">Petrarca</span>, <i>who is walking feverishly to and fro.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Gherardo</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). Listen. Another word, Francesco.</p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Petrarca.</i> <span style="margin-left: 20em;">Aih!</span><br />
And then another&mdash;that will breed another.</p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Gherardo.</i> Dote on this Laura still&mdash;if still you must:<br />
Woman's your destiny.<br/>
But quench these lights and set away that wine.<span class="pagenumb"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang">
<i>Petrarca.</i> And to no other lips turn? hers denied me?<br />
Never, Gherardo!</p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Gherardo.</i> <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Virtue bids you.</span></p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Petrarca.</i><span style="margin-left: 12em;"> Vainly!</span><br />
I've borne until I will not ... For it is<br />
Two years now since in the aisles<br />
Of Santa Clara yonder my heart first<br />
Went from me on mad wings.<br />
Two years this April morning<br />
Since it fell fluttering before her feet ...<br />
As she stood there beside our blessed Lady,<br />
Gowned as young Spring in green and violets!...</p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Gherardo.</i> And these two years have been inviolate;<span class="pagenumb"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><br />
Your life as pure as hers,<br />
As virgin&mdash;<br />
Save for the songs you've sung to her; those songs<br />
This idle city echoes with. But now&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Petrarca.</i> Now I will open all the gates to Pleasure!<br />
To rosy Pleasure&mdash;warm, unspiritual,<br />
Ready to spring<br />
Into the arms of all<br />
Whom bloodless Virtue pales.<br />
For, of restraint and hoping, I have drunk<br />
But a vintage of tears!<br />
And what has been my gain?</p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Gherardo.</i><span style="margin-left: 9em;"> Her chastity.</span><span class="pagenumb"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Petrarca.</i> A chastity unchallenged of desire&mdash;<br />
And therefore none!<br />
Aih, none!<br />
For, were it other;<br />
Could I aver that once, that ever once<br />
Her lids had fallen low in fear of love,<br />
I'd bid the desert of my heart burn dry&mdash;<br />
To the last oasis&mdash;<br />
With resignation!<br />
But never have they, never! and I'm mad.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Pours out wine.</i>)</p>

<p class="hang">
<i>Gherardo.</i> And you will seek to cure it with more madness?<br />
To cast the devil of love out of your veins<br />

With little Sancia's!<br />
Whose soul is a sweet sin!<br />
Who lives but for this life and asks of Death<br />
Only a breath of time before he ends it,<br />
To tell three beads and fill her mouth with <i>aves</i>.<br />
Just for enough, she says,<br />
"To tell God that He made me"&mdash;as He did.</p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Gherardo.</i> And to blaspheme with! O obsessèd man.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Has risen, flushed.</i>)</p>

<p>
But you will fail! For this vain revelry<br />
Will ease not. And I see all love is base&mdash;<br />
As say the Fathers&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><br />
All!... and the body of woman<br />
Is vile from the beginning.</p>
<p class="hang">

<p class="center">(<i>Drinks again for courage.</i>)</p>

<p>
The body of woman's born of bliss and beauty.<br />
Only one thing is fairer&mdash;that's her soul.</p>
<p class="hang">
<i>Gherardo.</i> And is that Word which says thou shalt not look<br />
Upon another's wife a monkish lie?</p>

Your Laura is another's.</p>

Ugo di Sade's!<br />
A beast whose sullen mind two thoughts would drain;<br />
Whose breath is a poltroon's;<br />
Who is unkind.... I've seen her weep; who loves<br />
Her not.... And yet the fane of song I frame her,<br />
The love I burn on it, she laughs away.<br />
To hide her own?... I will not so believe.</p>

<p class="center">By</p>

<p class="center"><span class="big">CALE YOUNG RICE</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It presents a last phase of the Renaissance with great effect." <i>Sir
Sidney Lee.</i></p>

<p>"'Porzia' is a very romantic and beautiful thing. After a third reading
I enjoy and admire it still more." <i>Gilbert Murray.</i></p>

<p>"There are certain lyrical qualities in the dramas of Cale Young Rice
and certain dramatic qualities in many of his finest lyrics that make it
very difficult for the critic to resolve whether he is highest as singer
or dramatist. 'Porzia' is a poetic play in which these two gifts blend
with subtle and powerful effectiveness. It is not written in stereotyped
heroic verse, but in sensitive metrical lines that vary in beat and
measure with the strength, the tenderness, the anguish, bitterness and
passion of love or hate they have to express. The bizarre and poignant
central incident on which the action of 'Porzia' turns is such as would
have appealed irresistibly to the imagination and dramatic instincts of
the great Elizabethan dramatists, and Mr. Rice has developed it with a
force and imaginative beauty that they alone could have equaled and with
a restraint and delicacy of touch which makes pitiful and beautiful a
story they would have clothed in horror.... He turns what might have
been a tragic close to something that is loftier and more moving.... It
matters little that we hesitate between ranking Mr. Rice highest as
dramatist or lyrist; what matters is that he has the faculty divine
beyond any living poet of America; his inspiration is true, and his
poetry is the real thing." <i>The London Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"'Porzia' has the swift human movement which Mr. Rice puts into his
dramas, and technique of a very high order.... The dramatic form is the
most difficult to sustain harmoniously and this Mr. Rice always
achieves." <i>The Baltimore News.</i></p>

<p>"To the making of 'Porzia' Mr. Rice has summoned all the resources of
his dramatic skill. On the constructive side it is particularly
strong.... The opening scene is certainly one of the happiest Mr. Rice
has written, while the climaxing third act is a brilliant piece of
character study.... The play is rich in poetry;... in it Mr. Rice has
scored another success ... in a field where work of permanent value is
rarely achieved." <i>Albert S. Henry</i> (<i>The Book News Monthly</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice apes neither the high-flown style of the Elizabethans, nor the
turgid and cryptic style of Browning.... 'Porzia' should attract the
praise of all who wish to see real literature written in this country
again." <i>The Covington</i> (<i>Ky.</i>) <i>Post.</i></p>

<p>"The complete mastery of technique, the dignity and dramatic force of
the characters, the beauty of the language and clear directness of the
style together with the vivid imagination needed to portray so
strikingly the renaissance spirit and atmosphere, make the work one that
should last." <i>The Springfield</i> (<i>Mass.</i>) <i>Homestead.</i></p>

<p>"It is not unjust to say that Cale Young Rice holds in America the
position that Stephen Phillips holds in England." <i>The Scotsman</i>
(<i>Edinburgh</i>).</p>

<p>"Had no other poetic drama than this been written in America, there
would be hope for the future of poetry on the stage." <i>John G. Neihardt</i>
(<i>The Minneapolis Journal</i>).</p>

<p class="center"><span class="big">CALE YOUNG RICE</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The countrymen of Cale Young Rice apparently regard him as the equal of
the great American poets of the past. <i>Far Quests</i> is good
unquestionably. It shows a wide range of thought, and sympathy, and real
skill in workmanship, while occasionally it rises to heights of
simplicity and truth, that suggest such inspiration as should mean
lasting fame."&mdash;<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> (<i>London</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's lyrics are deeply impressive. A large number are complete
and full-blooded works of art."&mdash;<i>Prof. Wm. Lyon Phelps</i> (<i>Yale
University</i>).</p>

<p>"<i>Far Quests</i> contains much beautiful work&mdash;the work of a real poet in
imagination and achievement."&mdash;<i>Prof. J. W. Mackail</i> (<i>Oxford
University</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is determined to get away from local or national limitations
and be at whatever cost universal.... These poems are always animated by
a force and freshness of feeling rare in work of such high
virtuosity."&mdash;<i>The Scotsman</i> (<i>Edinburgh</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Cale Young Rice is acknowledged by his countrymen to be one of
their great poets. There is great charm in his nature songs (of this
volume) and in his songs of the East. Mr. Rice writes with great
simplicity and beauty."&mdash;<i>The Sphere</i> (<i>London</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's forte is poetic drama. Yet in the act of saying this the
critic is confronted by such poems as <i>The Mystic</i>.... These are the
poems of a thinker, a man of large horizons, an optimist profoundly
impressed with the pathos of man's quest for happiness in all
lands."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's latest volume shows no diminuition of poetic power.
Fecundity is a mark of the genuine poet, and a glance through these
pages will demonstrate how rich Mr. Rice is in vitality and variety of
thought.... There is too, the unmistakable quality of style. It is
spontaneous, flexible, and strong with the strength of simplicity&mdash;a
style of rare distinction."&mdash;<i>Albert S. Henry</i>, (<i>The Book News Monthly,
Philadelphia</i>).</p>

<p class="center"><span class="big">CALE YOUNG RICE</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is great art&mdash;with great vitality. <i>James Lane Allen.</i></p>

<p>In the midst of the Spring rush there arrives one book for which all
else is pushed aside.... We have been educated to the belief that a man
must be long dead before he can be enrolled with the great ones. Let us
forget this cruel teaching.... This volume contains four poetic dramas
all different in setting, and all so beautiful that we cannot choose one
more perfect than another.... Too extravagant praise cannot be given Mr.
Rice. <i>The San Francisco Call.</i></p>

<p>Four brief dramas, different from Paola &amp; Francesca, but excelling
it&mdash;or any other of Mr. Phillips's work, it is safe to say&mdash;in a vivid
presentment of a supreme moment in the lives of the characters.... They
form excellent examples of the range of Mr. Rice's genius in this field.
<i>The New York Times Review.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice is quite the most ambitious, and most distinguished of
contemporary poetic dramatists in America. <i>The Boston Transcript</i> (<i>W.
S. Braithwaite.</i>)</p>

<p>The vigor and originality of Mr. Rice's work never outweigh that first
qualification, beauty.... No American writer has so enriched the body of
our poetic literature in the past few years. <i>The New Orleans Picayune.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice is beyond doubt the most distinguished poetic dramatist America
has yet produced. <i>The Detroit Free Press.</i></p>

<p>That in Cale Young Rice a new American poet of great power and
originality has arisen cannot be denied. He has somehow discovered the
secret of the mystery, wonder and spirituality of human existence,
which has been all but lost in our commercial civilization. May he
succeed in awakening our people from sordid dreams of gain. <i>Rochester</i>
(<i>N. Y.</i>) <i>Post Express.</i></p>

<p>No writer in England or America holds himself to higher ideals (than Mr.
Rice) and everything he does bears the imprint of exquisite taste and
the finest poetic instinct. <i>The Portland Oregonian.</i></p>

<p>In simplicity of art form and sheer mystery of romanticism these poetic
dramas embody the new century artistry that is remaking current
imaginative literature. <i>The Philadelphia North American.</i></p>

<p>Cale Young Rice is justly regarded as the leading master of the
difficult form of poetic drama. <i>Portland</i> (<i>Me.</i>) <i>Press.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice has outlived the prophesy that he would one day rival Stephen
Phillips in the poetic drama. As dexterous in the mechanism of his art,
the young American is the Englishman's superior in that unforced quality
which bespeaks true inspiration, and in a wider variety of manner and
theme. <i>San Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice's work has often been compared to Stephen Phillips's and there
is great resemblance in their expression of high vision. Mr. Rice's
technique is sure ... his knowledge of his settings impeccable, and one
feels sincerely the passion, power and sensuous beauty of the whole.
"Arduin" (one of the plays) is perfect tragedy; as rounded as a sphere,
as terrible as death. <i>Review of Reviews.</i></p>

<p>The Immortal Lure is a very beautiful work. <i>The Springfield</i> (<i>Mass.</i>)
<i>Republican.</i></p>

<p>The action in Mr. Rice's dramas is invariably compact and powerful, his
writing remarkably forcible and clear, with a rare grasp of form. The
plays are brief and classic. <i>Baltimore News.</i></p>

<p>These four dramas, each a separate unit perfect in itself and differing
widely in treatment, are yet vitally related by reason of the one
central theme, wrought out with rich imagery and with compelling
dramatic power. <i>The Louisville Times</i> (<i>U. S.</i>)</p>

<p>The literary and poetical merit of these dramas is undeniable, and they
are charged with the emotional life and human interest that should, but
do not, always go along with those other high gifts. <i>The</i> (<i>London</i>)
<i>Bookman.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Rice never [like Stephen Phillips] mistakes strenuous phrase for
strong thought. He makes his blank verse his servant, and it has the
stage merit of possessing the freedom of prose while retaining the
impassioned movement of poetry. <i>The Glasgow</i> (<i>Scotland</i>) <i>Herald.</i></p>

<p>These firm and vivid pieces of work are truly welcome as examples of
poetic force that succeeds without the help of poetic license. <i>The
Literary World</i> (<i>London.</i>)</p>

<p>We do not possess a living American poet whose utterance is so clear, so
felicitous, so free from the inane and meretricious folly of sugared
lines.... No one has a better understanding of the development of
dramatic action than Mr. Rice. <i>The Book News Monthly</i> (<i>Albert S.
Henry.</i>)</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice has the gift of leadership ... and he is a force with whom we

<p>"When you hear the pessimists bewailing the good old time when real
poets were abroad in the land ... do not fail to quote them almost
anything by Cale Young Rice, a real poet writing to-day.... He has done
so much splendid work one can scarcely praise him too highly." <i>The San
Francisco Call.</i></p>

<p>"In 'Many Gods' the scenes are those of the East, and while it is not
the East of Loti, Arnold or Hearn, it is still a place of brooding,
majesty, mystery and subtle fascination. There is a temptation to quote
such verses for their melody, dignity of form, beauty of imagery and
height of inspiration." <i>The Chicago Journal.</i></p>

<p>"'Love's Cynic' (a long poem in the volume) might be by Browning at his

<p>"Mr. Rice has the technical cunning that makes up almost the entire
equipment of many poets nowadays, but human nature is more to him always
... and he has the feeling and imaginative sympathy without which all
poetry is but an empty and vain thing." <i>The London Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's note is a clarion call, and of his two poems, 'The Strong
Man to His Sires' and 'The Young to the Old,' the former will send a
thrill to the heart of every man who has the instinct of race in his
blood, while the latter should be printed above the desk of every minor
poet and pessimist.... The sonnets of the sequence, 'Quest and
Requital,' have the elements of great poetry in them." <i>The Glasgow</i>
(<i>Scotland</i>) <i>Herald.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's poems are singularly free from affectation, and he seems to
have written because of the sincere need of expressing something that
had to take art form." <i>The Sun</i> (<i>New York</i>).</p>

<p>"The ability to write verse that scans is quite common.... But the
inspired thought behind the lines is a different thing; and it is this
thought untrammeled&mdash;the clear vision searching into the deeps of human
emotion&mdash;which gives the verse of Mr. Rice weight and potency.... In the
range of his metrical skill he easily stands with the best of living
craftsmen ... and we have in him ... a poet whose dramas and lyrics will
endure." <i>The Book News Monthly</i> (<i>A. S. Henry</i>).</p>

<p>"These poems are marked by a breadth of outlook, individuality and
beauty of thought. The author reveals deep, sincere feeling on topics
which do not readily lend themselves to artistic expression and which he
makes eminently worth while." <i>The Buffalo</i> (<i>N. Y.</i>) <i>Courier.</i></p>

<p>"We get throughout the idea of a vast universe and of the soul merging
itself in the infinite.... The great poem of the volume, however, is
'The Strong Man to His Sires.'" <i>The Louisville Post</i> (<i>Margaret S.

<p>"The poems possess much music ... and even in the height of intensified
feeling the clearness of Mr. Rice's ideas is not dimmed by the obscure
haze that too often goes with the divine fire." <i>The Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>"It leaves an enduring impression of a soul tragedy." <i>The Churchman.</i></p>

<p>"Since the publication of his 'Charles di Tocca' and other dramas, Cale
Young Rice has justly been regarded as a leading American master of that
difficult form, and many critics have ranked him above Stephen Phillips,
at least on the dramatic side of his art. And this judgment is further
confirmed by 'A Night in Avignon.' It is almost incredible that in less
than 500 lines Mr. Rice should have been able to create so perfect a
play with so powerful a dramatic effect." <i>The Chicago Record-Herald</i>
(<i>Edwin S. Shuman</i>).</p>

<p>"There is poetic richness in this brilliant composition; a beauty of

and dramatically powerful." <i>The Philadelphia Record.</i></p>

<p>"It offers one of the most striking situations in dramatic literature."
<i>The Louisville Courier-Journal.</i></p>

<p>"The publication of a poetic drama of the quality of Mr. Rice's is an
important event in the present tendency of American literature. He is a
leader in this most significant movement, and 'A Night in Avignon' is
marked, like his other plays, by dramatic directness, high poetic
fervor, clarity of poetic diction, and felicity of phrasing." <i>The

<p>"It is encouraging to the hope of a native drama to know that an
American has written a play which is at the same time of decided poetic
merit and of decided dramatic power." <i>The New York Times.</i></p>

<p>"The most remarkable quality of the play is its sustained dramatic
strength. Poetically it is frequently of great beauty. It is also lofty
in conception, lucid and felicitous in style, and the dramatic pulse
throbs in every line." <i>The Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p>"The characters are drawn with force and the play is dignified and
powerful," and adds that if it does not succeed on the stage it will be
"because of its excellence." <i>The Springfield Republican.</i></p>

production and will be welcomed by all who care for serious verse."</p>

<p><i>The Glasgow</i> (<i>Scotland</i>) <i>Herald</i> says: "Yolanda of Cyprus is finely
constructed; the irregular blank verse admirably adapted for the
exigencies of intense emotion; the characters firmly drawn; and the
climax serves the purpose of good stagecraft and poetic justice."</p>

<p>"It is well constructed and instinct with dramatic power." <i>Sydney Lee.</i></p>

<p>"It is as readable as a novel." <i>The Pittsburg Post.</i></p>

<p>"Here and there an almost Shakespearean note is struck. In makeup,
arrangement, and poetic intensity it ranks with Stephen Phillips's
work." <i>The Book News Monthly.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="big">CALE YOUNG RICE</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was greatly impressed with it and derived a sense of personal
encouragement from the evidence of so fine and lofty a product for the
stage." <i>Richard Mansfield.</i></p>

<p>"It is a powerful piece of dramatic portraiture in which Cale Young Rice
has again demonstrated his insight and power. What he did before in
'Charles di Tocca' he has repeated and improved upon.... Not a few
instances of his strength might be cited as of almost Shakespearean
force. Indeed the strictly literary merit of the tragedy is altogether
extraordinary. It is a contribution to the drama full of charm and
power." <i>The Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"From the standpoint of poetry, dignity of conception, spiritual
elevation and finish and beauty of line, Mr. Rice's 'David' is, perhaps,
superior to his 'Yolanda of Cyprus,' but the two can scarcely be
compared." <i>The New York Times</i> (<i>Jessie B. Rittenhouse</i>).</p>

<p>"Never before has the theme received treatment in a manner so worthy of
it." <i>The St. Louis Globe-Democrat.</i></p>

<p>"It needs but a word, for it has been passed upon and approved by
critics all over the country." <i>Book News Monthly.</i> And again: "But few
recent writers seem to have found the secret of dramatic blank verse;
and of that small number, Mr. Rice is, if not first, at least without
superior."</p>

<p>"With instinctive dramatic and poetic power, Mr. Rice combines a
knowledge of the exigencies of the stage." <i>Harper's Weekly.</i></p>

<p>"It is safe to say that were Mr. Rice an Englishman or a Frenchman, his
reputation as his country's most distinguished poetic dramatist would
have been assured by a more universal sign of recognition." <i>The
Baltimore News</i> (<i>writing of all Mr. Rice's plays</i>).</p>

<p>"I take off my hat to Mr. Rice. His play is full of poetry, and the
pitch and dignity of the whole are remarkable." <i>James Lane Allen.</i></p>

<p>"It is a dramatic poem one reads with a heightened sense of its fine
quality throughout. It is sincere, strong, finished and noble, and
sustains its distinction of manner to the end.... The character of
Helena is not unworthy of any of the great masters of dramatic
utterance." <i>The Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"The drama is one of the best of the kind ever written by an American
author. Its whole tone is masterful, and it must be classed as one of
the really literary works of the season." (1903). <i>The Milwaukee
Sentinel.</i></p>

<p>"It shows a remarkable sense of dramatic construction as well as poetic
power and strong characterization." <i>James MacArthur, in Harper's
Weekly.</i></p>

<p>"This play has many elements of perfection. Its plot is developed with
ease and with a large dramatic force; its characters are drawn with
sympathy and decision; and its thoughts rise to a very real beauty. By
reason of it the writer has gained an assured place among playwrights
who seek to give literary as well as dramatic worth to their plays."
<i>The Richmond</i> (<i>Va.</i>) <i>News-Leader.</i></p>

<p>"The action of the play is admirably compact and coherent, and it
contains tragic situations which will afford pleasure not only to the
student, but to the technical reader." <i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p>"It is the most powerful, vital, and truly tragical drama written by an
American for some years. There is genuine pathos, mighty yet never
repellent passion, great sincerity and penetration, and great elevation
and beauty of language." <i>The Chicago Post.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice ranks among America's choicest poets on account of his power
to turn music into words, his virility, and of the fact that he has
something of his own to say." <i>The Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>"The whole play breathes forth the indefinable spirit of the Italian
renaissance. In poetic style and dramatic treatment it is a work of
art." <i>The Baltimore Sun.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's work betrays wide sympathies with nature and life, and a
welcome originality of sentiment and metrical harmony." <i>Sydney Lee.</i></p>

<p>"In his lyrics Mr. Rice's imagination works most successfully. He is an
optimist&mdash;and in these days an optimist is irresistible&mdash;and he can
touch delicately things too holy for a rough or violent pathos." <i>The
London Star</i> (<i>James Douglas</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's highest gift is essentially lyrical. His lyrics have a charm
and grace of melody distinctively their own." <i>The London Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's poems are touched with the magic of the muse. They have
inspiration, grace and true lyric quality." <i>The Book News Monthly.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's poetry as a whole is both strongly and delicately spiritual.
Many of these lyrics have the true romantic mystery and charm.... To
write thus is no indifferent matter. It indicates not only long work but
long brooding on the beauty and mystery of life." <i>The Louisville Post.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is indisputably one of the greatest poets who have lived in

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
